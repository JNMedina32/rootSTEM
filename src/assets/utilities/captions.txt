{"so  encoding  do  these  numbers  here 
 represent  anything  to  you  well  97  is  the 
 Unicode  for  a  and  one  two  two  is  the 
 Unicode  for  Z  so  the  Unicode  is  a 
 standardized  encoding  system  for 
 representing  characters  and  symbols  so 
 free  console  log  string  of  a  and  we  use 
 the  Char  code  at  method  and  we  say  zero 
 so  it's  going  to  be  at  the  zeroth  index 
 here  so  that's  going  to  be  a  if  we 
 console  log  that  as  well  as  Z  we're 
 going  to  get  97  and  1  2  2.  so  here  we 
 have  a  string  we  want  to  validate  that 
 contains  only  letters  from  A  to  Z  so  we 
 want  this  to  return  false  so  what  we  can 
 do  is  Loop  through  the  characters  of  the 
 string  and  use  the  Unicode  to  work  this 
 out  so  if  string  charco.i  if  this  is 
 less  than  97  so  remember  this  is  the 
 Unicode  for  a  if  it's  less  than  that  or 
 I  is  greater  than  one  to  two  so  the  uni 
 code  for  Z  we  can  return  false  because 
 all  the  numbers  between  97  and  1  to  2 
 count  for  all  the  letters  from  A  to  Z  if 
 it  falls  outside  this  range  then  it's 
 not  in  the  alphabet  so  one  for  example 
 is  not  going  to  fall  inside  that  range 
 otherwise  we  can  return  true  here  it's 
 console  log  this  run  it  and  as  you  can 
 see  we've  got  false  so  this  can  prove  a 
 very  useful  technique  for  coding 
 interviews  and  get  you  out  of  sticky 
 situations", "the  most  annoying  thing  programmers  have 
 to  deal  with  is  authentication  if  I  was 
 building  an  app  with  authentication  it 
 would  need  magic  links  social  logins 
 user  permissions  two-factor 
 authentication  and  more  it's  kind  of  a 
 given  so  I'm  using  Propel  auth  to  allow 
 me  to  have  those  features  that  people 
 trust  and  expect  instantly  while  I  focus 
 on  building  the  core  functionality  with 
 just  a  few  lines  of  code  in  my  backend 
 framework  I  can  get  features  like  role 
 management  built-in  domain  invitations 
 and  more  authentication  is  extremely 
 important  but  if  you  need  to  get  your 
 app  out  in  the  world  to  validate  it 
 build  as  fast  as  you  can  if  you  don't 
 have  to  there's  really  no  point  in 
 Touching  Authentication", "so  anti-matter  is  real  but  it's  also  not 
 scary  hear  me  out  everything  around  you 
 is  made  of  matter  particles  like  protons 
 neutrons  and  electrons  anti-matter  is 
 almost  exactly  like  all  that  regular 
 matter  it  just  has  the  opposite  electric 
 charge  like  electrons  have  a  negative 
 charge  but  an  antimatter  electron  called 
 a  positron  has  a  positive  charge  and 
 that's  basically  the  only  major 
 difference  I  mean  there  are  also  some 
 very  tiny  other  changes  but  they're  just 
 beside  the  point  here  see  not  scary 
 there  is  the  part  where  if  a  matter 
 particle  hits  its  antimatter  counterpart 
 they'll  like  annihilate  each  other  and 
 release  a  bunch  of  energy  but  that's 
 also  not  anything  you  need  to  worry 
 about  because  there  is  a  disturbing  lack 
 of  antimatter  in  the  universe  oh  why 
 covered  one  of  the  one of  the  big 
 mysteries  in  physics"}
